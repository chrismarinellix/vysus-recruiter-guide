# Vysus Group - Power Systems Engineer Assessment Guide

## Company Context

Vysus Group provides specialist engineering consultancy for renewable energy grid connections in Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM). Engineers perform grid connection studies for solar, wind, and BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) projects, ensuring compliance with the National Electricity Rules (NER) and generator performance standards (GPS).

Our engineers work directly with project developers, NSPs (Network Service Providers such as Transgrid, Powerlink, ElectraNet, AusNet, Western Power), and AEMO to deliver R1 and R2 grid connection studies. The work is highly technical, requiring simulation expertise in EMT (Electromagnetic Transient) and RMS (phasor/dynamic) modelling tools.

## Role Level Definitions

### Senior Engineer — Technical Delivery
**Core Expectation**: Can independently deliver R1 and R2 grid connection studies end-to-end with minimal oversight.

| # | Competency | What "Strong" Looks Like | What "Partial" Looks Like |
|---|-----------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Independent R1/R2 study delivery | Has led or completed R1/R2, DMAT, DMNT, or full grid connection studies | Has assisted on studies or worked in related power systems analysis |
| 2 | Proficiency in PSCAD and/or PSS/E | Explicitly names PSCAD or PSS/E with project context | Mentions DIgSILENT, PowerFactory, ETAP, or generic simulation experience |
| 3 | EMT & RMS simulation execution | Describes running EMT or RMS simulations, interpreting results | General power systems simulation without specifying EMT/RMS |
| 4 | Grid code compliance assessment | References NER, S5.2, GPS, or generator performance standards | General compliance or regulatory work without NER specifics |
| 5 | Model validation & tuning | Describes validating or tuning generator/inverter models against test data | General model development or testing without validation context |
| 6 | Technical report writing | Mentions writing study reports, technical documentation | General report writing in an engineering context |
| 7 | Client communication | Describes presenting to or communicating with clients/stakeholders | General teamwork or communication skills mentioned |
| 8 | Team knowledge contribution | Describes mentoring juniors, knowledge sharing, or training activities | General teamwork references |

### Lead Engineer — Technical Leadership
**Core Expectation**: All Senior competencies PLUS leads projects and develops people. Owns client relationships and engages directly with NSPs/AEMO.

| # | Competency | What "Strong" Looks Like | What "Partial" Looks Like |
|---|-----------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Mentors and develops engineers | Explicitly describes mentoring, coaching, or developing team members | References working with junior staff without explicit mentoring |
| 2 | Project leadership & oversight | Named as project lead/manager with deliverable accountability | General team lead or coordination role |
| 3 | Direct NSP/AEMO engagement | Names specific NSPs (Transgrid, Powerlink, etc.) or AEMO interaction | General utility or regulator engagement |
| 4 | Project budget management | Describes managing budgets, cost control, or financial forecasting | Awareness of commercial aspects without direct management |
| 5 | Client relationship ownership | Primary point of contact for clients, manages accounts | Regular client interaction without ownership |
| 6 | Technical review & QA sign-off | Reviews and approves others' technical work | Participates in peer review without sign-off authority |
| 7 | Scope definition & proposal input | Writes or contributes to proposals, tenders, scope documents | Aware of proposal processes |
| 8 | Multi-project coordination | Manages or coordinates across multiple concurrent projects | Works on multiple projects without coordination role |
| 9 | Technical risk assessment | Identifies and manages technical risks on projects | General awareness of project risks |

### Principal Engineer — Strategic Leadership
**Core Expectation**: All Lead competencies PLUS strategic oversight and business growth. Recognised industry voice.

| # | Competency | What "Strong" Looks Like | What "Partial" Looks Like |
|---|-----------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Strategic oversight across projects | Portfolio or program-level management, strategic direction setting | Oversees large projects without portfolio responsibility |
| 2 | Business development & growth | Wins new work, develops client pipeline, revenue targets | Supports BD activities without direct ownership |
| 3 | Senior client advisory | Provides strategic guidance to senior client stakeholders | Regular client advisory at project level |
| 4 | Team capacity & capability planning | Plans team growth, capability gaps, recruitment strategy | Identifies skills needs without strategic planning role |
| 5 | Guides Leads on complex decisions | Provides technical direction to other leads/seniors | Makes complex technical decisions independently |
| 6 | Industry thought leadership | Conference presentations, publications, working group membership | Industry awareness without public contribution |
| 7 | Proposal strategy & pricing oversight | Owns win strategy, pricing decisions, commercial terms | Contributes to proposals without strategic ownership |
| 8 | Market positioning & service offering | Shapes service offerings, identifies market opportunities | Understands market without shaping strategy |

## Scoring Rules

### Skill Match Scoring
- **"strong"**: Resume explicitly demonstrates the competency with specific examples, project names, tools named, or measurable outcomes
- **"partial"**: Resume shows related experience that suggests capability but does not directly confirm the exact competency
- **"none"**: No evidence in resume text. Do NOT infer or assume capabilities not stated. When in doubt, mark "none"

### Role Score Calculation
- Each role score (0-100) should reflect the percentage of that role's competencies the candidate demonstrates at "strong" or "partial" level
- Weight "strong" matches more heavily than "partial" matches
- A candidate with all "strong" matches = 100, all "partial" = ~50-60, all "none" = 0

### Level Recommendation
- **Senior**: Demonstrates majority of Senior competencies (score >= 50), particularly items 1-5 (core technical skills)
- **Lead**: Meets Senior requirements AND demonstrates majority of Lead competencies, particularly mentoring, project leadership, and client/NSP engagement
- **Principal**: Meets Lead requirements AND demonstrates strategic and business development capabilities
- **Below Senior**: Lacks core technical delivery skills (no simulation tool experience, no grid connection study experience)

### Critical Assessment Rules
1. ONLY base analysis on information explicitly stated in the resume
2. Do NOT infer, assume, or fabricate skills not clearly mentioned
3. Power systems experience in non-renewable sectors (e.g., transmission planning, protection) is valuable but should be scored as "partial" for renewable-specific competencies
4. International experience (non-Australian NEM) is valid but note it — NER/AEMO/NSP knowledge may need development
5. Academic qualifications in power systems support but do not replace practical experience
6. Software tool proficiency must be explicitly named — do not assume tool knowledge from general simulation experience
